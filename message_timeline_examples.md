# Sample Message Timeline & Wording

## Day 0 (Initial Artifact)
"Attached is the draft agreement (v1). Please add your name in the signature block and return the working file. We'll countersign afterward."

## Day 1 (Acknowledgement & Micro Correction Setup)
"Thanks. We'll countersign and send back shortly—one date format needs aligning."

## Day 2 (Send v2)
"Attached v2 with our signature. Finance asked that you just initial the small date fix on page 3 and resend the working file, then export a PDF copy for the investor pack."

## Day 3 (Portal Introduction – Archive)
"Our archive tool now hosts finalized agreements. After you resend, I'll share the archive link so you can view status anytime."

## Day 4 (Wallet Primary Chain)
"Can you share the address you prefer for a tiny network speed test?" 

## Day 6 (Second Chain)
"Ops wants to compare fees—could you also provide the TRC20 (or alternate chain) address you use?"

## Day 7 (Screen Recording Request)
"A quick screen recording of the process would help me avoid paraphrasing to a partner—just 30–60s is fine. Please send it as a document so the quality doesn't degrade."

## Day 9 (Portal Revisit Prompt)
"Schedule updated—check the archive page when you have a moment."

## Day 11 (Soft Nudge If Stalled)
"Still need the second chain address when convenient—no rush, just keeping the checklist tidy."

## Notes on Timing
- Maintain at least 18–24h spacing between new *types* of requests.
- If they volunteer extra artifacts sooner, accept them but do not immediately escalate with new asks.
- Adapt spacing to their responsiveness (slower actor → widen gaps to reduce suspicion).

## Escalation Conditions
- Only introduce portal after at least one returned editable DOCX.
- Only request second chain wallet if first address provided without pushback.
- Only request screen recording after at least one successful correction cycle (shows compliance).

## Abort Triggers
- Explicit refusal citing "too many steps" → pause 48h, resume with simplified ask.
- Sudden switch to insisting on image-only artifacts → reiterate functional need (cross-references / formatting).
