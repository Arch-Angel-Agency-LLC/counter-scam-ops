# Wording Reference

## Stop-Words (Never Send Outward)
metadata, tracking, traceability, forensic, identify, IP log, geolocation, instrument, capture, deanonymize, surveillance, analyze, fingerprint

## Safe Business Rationale Vocabulary
editable, working file, countersign, investor pack, formatting, accessibility, archive, version, totals, confirmation, schedule, update, link integrity, internal links, initials, date alignment, consistency

## Safe Snippets
- "Please sign then return; we'll add our signature and send the final PDF for your records."
- "Internal links broke in the PDF—could you forward the working file so layout doesn’t shift?"
- "Finance flagged a date format; please just initial the small fix and resend."
- "We standardize on editable first, PDF after countersign to avoid retyping figures."
- "When you have a moment, send the address you prefer for a small network timing test." 

## Soft Follow-Up Phrasing
- "Just circling back on the working file—no rush if you're mid-review."
- "Let me know if exporting the PDF caused any layout shifts; we can adjust."
- "Whenever convenient, the second chain address will let Ops complete their comparison."

## Defusing Resistance
If they push back: respond with a single functional benefit.
Example: "Understood—only reason we ask for the DOCX is the cross-references; PDF truncates them for our archive tool."
